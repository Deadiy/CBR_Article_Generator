            "One of the strangest things about Japan's #1 Hero is the fact that he just doesn't look Japanese. All Might is heavily modeled off of the American sensibility of superheroes, as well as Japan's perception of the ideal American as a whole, i.e. large, buff, blonde, and blue-eyed. A lot of this can be chocked up to Kohei Horikoshi's Marvel influences and the current boom of the superhero genre.</p><p>In story, however, All Might did work and train in Los Angeles, California before he took his mantle in Japan. The American influences are apparent in his costume and move set, with attacks like Texas and Oklahoma Smash, attacks that generate tornadoes, actually correlating with the U.S.'s tornado heavy territories.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">4 </span>How Old Is He?</h2><figure><img src='https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Young-All-Might-My-Hero-Academia.jpg' /></figure><p>Given his abilities and unique condition, All Might's appearance varies wildly across the series. In his hero form, he's large and healthy, practically brimming with life. However, in his regular form, he looks like he really should be in a hospital. He's incredibly skinny, constantly coughing up blood, and has abyss like eyes that should haunt children.</p><p>Such disparity in his appearance makes it hard for fans to gauge how old he really is. However, working with the story's timeline and some analysis by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB9_VH_CNbbH4GfKu8qh63w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Death Battle</a> and a really detailed <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-old-is-All-Might-from-My-Hero-Academia\">Quora post</a>, All Might is most likely 48 at the beginning of the series and 49 in the current story.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">3 </span>Is He Going To Die?</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/All-Might-Nighteye-Flashbackkk.jpg' /></figure><p>All Might is one of those characters that just waves a death flag as soon as he premieres. Out of a lot of anime characters, he probably has the least ambiguity given his regular form's demeanor and the comedic tendency to constantly be coughing up blood. Many thought that his recent encounter with All for One would be his last, but he was fortunately able to pull through. However, the appearance of his old sidekick, Sir Nighteye, would soon bring fans back to earth.</p><p><span class=\"related-single\">RELATED: <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/death-flags-anime-character-die/\">10 Death Flags That Mean An Anime Character is Probably Going To Die</a></span></p><p>In a flashback to the events after All Might beat All for One for the first time, Nighteye predicted that he would die in six to seven years to a powerful villain. About five years had passed between then and the moment that he met Midoriya Izuku. Despite his major victory and his propensity to remain in the sidelines, All Might's reckoning is coming very soon.</p><h2 class=\"item-title\"><span class=\"item-num\">2 </span>What's His Relationship With Detective Naomasa?</h2><figure><img src='https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Naomasa-with-backup.jpg' /></figure><p>One of All Might's most understated and mysterious relationships is with one Detective Naomasa. After the events of the Stain Arc, Midoriya was surprised to find that a regular detective not only knew All Might's secrets, but was one of his closest friends. Since then, Naomasa hasn't really been brought up much, leaving fans to speculate how close he and the #1 really were and if he would turn up as the infamous traitor.</p><p>However, <em>My Hero Academia: Vigilantes</em> would stifle some of those worries, as it would actually go into detail on their history. Naomasa is actually a detective who happened to discover All Might's secret identity after a comedic turn of events. However, he not only promised to keep All Might's secret\n"
